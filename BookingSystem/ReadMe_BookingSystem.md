# Booking System

This Java program implements a simple booking system for a hotel. Users can make reservations, cancel reservations, view invoices, and see hotel information through a command-line interface.

## Files
1. **BookingSystem.java**: Contains the main class `BookingSystem` which drives the booking system. It prompts users with options to interact with the system.
2. **Hotel.java**: Defines the `Hotel` class which manages hotel information, rooms, reservations, and operations such as creating and canceling reservations, and printing invoices.
3. **Reservation.java**: Defines the `Reservation` class representing a single reservation with a customer name and a reserved room.
4. **Room.java**: Defines the `Room` class representing a hotel room. It includes methods to check availability, change availability status, and find available rooms of a specific type.

## How to Use
1. Compile all Java files.
2. Run the `BookingSystem` class.
3. Follow the prompts to interact with the booking system:
   - Make a reservation
   - Cancel a reservation
   - View an invoice
   - See hotel information
   - Exit the booking system

## Note
- Ensure you have Java installed on your system to compile and run the program.
- This is a simplified booking system, thus may not cover all edge cases or real-world scenarios.
